# Nuanced Coq
The repository is separated into two parts : NuancedSsreflect and Coqart

With a pre-request of knowledge about intuistic logic and simple type theory, the reader is recommanded to 

~ Study the usage of Coq with the book "Coq's art"

https://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/logic/TypesSS05/resources/coq/CoqArt/

where the note of its exercises are written in ./Coqart/ in the form of Ssreflect

~ Study the usage of ssreflect with the manual "An Ssreflect Tutorial"

https://inria.hal.science/inria-00407778v1/document

where the note and explanation of its designing logic are written in ./NuancedSsreflect.v

The nuanced specification should suffer while promoting the magnificent idea to the front line.
